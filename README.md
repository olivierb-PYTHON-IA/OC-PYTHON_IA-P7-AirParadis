# OC-PYTHON_IA-P7-AirParadis

The goal of this project is to detect bad buzz in tweets using Natural Language Processing models. The tweets come from the Kaggle Sentiment140 dataset and the model is deployed using an API with Azure.

Project 7 - Air Paradis :
- Main Topic : Deep Neural Networks - Natural Language Processing (NLP) : Sentiment Analysis
- Dataset : Kaggle Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6 million tweets
- New Python Packages : Tensorflow / Keras / Transformers (HuggingFace)
- New Concepts : 
   + Words Embeddings : GloVe / FastText
   + Deep Neural Networks : RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) / LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) / GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)
   + Transformers : BERT Model
- Azure : Azure Machine Learning
- Deployment : API with Azure
